## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Healthcare organizations struggle to understand **screening participation trends** across diverse groups.

Challenges include:  
- ❌ No real-time visibility into screening participation  
- ❌ Screening disparities due to **race, ethnicity, language, or geographic location**  
- ❌ Unstructured data making reporting time-consuming  
- ❌ Inability to identify **gaps for targeted outreach**  

Lack of insights results in **inefficient resource allocation** and **lower screening completion rates**.

## ✅ Proposed Solution  
A fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** that:

1️⃣ Shows **key screening KPIs** (Participation %, Total Eligible, Missed Screenings)  
2️⃣ Provides **demographic segmentation** by race, ethnicity, region, and language  
3️⃣ Includes a **filter panel** for customized views  
4️⃣ Enables **data-driven decision-making** to focus on underserved groups
